## What is the goal of PyPalette?
The current goal for PyPalette is not very defined. My plan is to incorporate as many different functionalities relating to colors and images as possible. There are so many things to do that I feel like going with the wind is the best way currently. Any suggestions are welcome and encouraged.

## What does PyPalette currently do?
1. **Color Space Conversions**
  - CMYK -> RGB
  - Hex -> RGB
  - HSI -> RGB
  - HSL -> RGB
  - HSV -> RGB
  - RGB -> CMYK
  - RGB -> Hex
  - RGB -> HSI
  - RGB -> HSL
  - RGB -> HSV
2. **Image Color Analysis**
  - Average color

## What are some things on the TODO list?
- Thorough documentation
- Thoroughly testing all functions
- K-means++ implementation for adaptive color palette generation
- Median color
- Grayscale
- Sepia
- Image blending
- Dithering
- Easy access to CSS3 colors
- Retro game console palettes
