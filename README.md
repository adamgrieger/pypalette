## What is the goal of PyPalette?
The current goal for PyPalette is not very defined. My plan is to incorporate as many different functionalities relating to colors and images as possible. There are so many things that can be done that I feel like going with the wind is the best way currently. Any suggestions are welcome and encouraged!

## What does PyPalette currently do?
1. **Color Space Conversions**
  - RGB :arrows_counterclockwise: CMYK
  - RGB :arrows_counterclockwise: Hex
  - RGB :arrows_counterclockwise: HSL
  - RGB :arrows_counterclockwise: HSV
2. **Image Color Analysis**
  - Average color
3. **Color Lists**
  - CSS3
  - Google Material Design

## What are some things on the TODO list?
- Clustering
    * Optimize K-means if possible
    * Median-cut?
- Documentation / Testing
    * Thoroughly document ALL THE THINGS
    * Make unit tests for ALL THE THINGS
- Palettes
    * Palette lists
        * :video_game: Retro console palettes
        * :art: Crayon colors
        * :us: Country flags
        * ABS and PBT plastic colors
        * Something, something colors (I'll make a color list of fruit indigenous to Jamaica if I am so inclined)
        * ColourLovers support?
    * Palette class for percentage-based color palettes
- Image Processes/Analysis
    * Median color, grayscale, sepia, etc.
    * Dithering and noise
    * Image blending
    * "Daltonization" for the color-blind?
