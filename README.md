# PyPalette
A (WIP) collection of tools for manipulating and analyzing images.

## What is the goal of PyPalette?
The current goal for PyPalette is not very defined. My plan is to incorporate as many different functionalities relating to colors and images as possible. There are so many things to do that I feel like going with the wind is the best way currently. Any suggestions are welcome and encouraged.

## What does PyPalette currently do?
1. **Color Space Conversions**
  - CMYK -> RGB
  - Hex -> RGB
  - HSL -> RGB
  - HSV -> RGB
  - RGB -> HSV
  - RGB -> HSL
  - RGB -> CMYK
  - RGB -> Hex
2. **Image Color Analysis**
  - Average color

## What are some planned features?
- Thorough documentation
- RGB to HSI conversion
- HSI to RGB conversion
- K-means++ implementation for adaptive color palette generation
- Median color
- Grayscale
- Sepia
- Image blending
- Dithering
